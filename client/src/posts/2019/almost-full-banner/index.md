You need to come up with entirely new toolkit or you won’t make it. Those tools exist because every subject is much easier than people who wish to make money teaching it would have you know.

For every single subject that can be systematized, there is systematization that allows you to get 80% of power, with probably 5-10% of the effort, and so key question is that you have to prove that you have superpower to rearrange the subject to disintermediate people who get paid teaching it, which will always push you to mastery, which is a question of getting last 2-3% out of system.

And so, the good news is you can rearrange any subject to learn most of it very very quickly. The bad news is that will feel terrible because you will be told you are doing it wrong way and dooming yourself to a life of mediocrity as a jack of many trades - master of none, but in fact problem is that jack of one trade is the connector of none. - Eric Weinstein
